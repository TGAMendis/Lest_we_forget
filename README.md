# Lest We Forget
Give to those who have given

"They died for something that may seem trivial to many: 
a piece of high ground on a salty sand dune, 
a landing area on a landmine-filled beach, 
or simply protecting a Cadjan bunker in some remote corner of the island. 

But when dusk settles on this protracted war, 
every sacrifice these thousands made will have a reason and purpose.
We should pay tribute to all our fallen heroes who gave their today for our tomorrow."
